        <h2>The New Jersey Coastline (cont'd)</h2>
        <p>There are some noteworthy sights along the New Jersey coastline.</p>
        <h3>Jersey City:</h3>
        <p>The most prominent area on the Jersey coastline is Jersey City, which
        presents an impressive skyline of modern skyscrapers. These building mostly
        date from the post 9/11 period, when Financial District firms were looking
        for an inexpensive, secure and nearby location for back offices. </p>
        
        <h3>Port Newark and Elizabeth Marine Terminal:</h3>
        <p>The largest container port on the East Coast. It is also home to IKEA and 
        is served by the New Jersey Turnpike.</p> 
        
        <h3>The Bayonne Bridge:</h3>
        <p>Spanning the Kill Van Kull, the body of water that separates New Jersey 
        from Staten Island, this bridge connects port facilities in the two states.</p>
